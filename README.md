### Hi there 👋

Prospective double major in CS & ITI @ Rutgers University-New Brunswick

My projects have mostly been influenced by my classes, but I always come back to refine them even after the deadline so that I can build on my knowledge :)

* I am currently pursuing the AWS cloud practitioner certification to make a smoother transition into cloud technologies
* Contact me @ HuzaifahMajid@gmail.com
* Fun Fact: My hobby is flipping homes
